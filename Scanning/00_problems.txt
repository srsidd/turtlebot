-----------spinning robot-------------
PROBLEM: When using acml for navigation, the turtlebot will sometimes follow the path to goal by spinning around continuously
SOLUTION: It seems to have something to do with the parameters that specify how closely it follows a policy, 
how to change the parameters:
/opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_navigation/param/dwa_local_planner_params.yaml
I thought i should change path_distance_bias (but this didn't seem to help)
dropped goal_distance_bias to 5.0
raised forward_point_distance to .5
i also raised max_scaling_factor to .3 because it sometimes gets too close to walls (and I hope this well help that)
